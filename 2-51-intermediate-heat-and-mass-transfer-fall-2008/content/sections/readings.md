Background Topics
-----------------

Students in this course are expected to be somewhat familiar with the following topics from their previous coursework. We will extend the material in various areas, particularly multidimensional heat conduction and analysis of convection. We will approach thermal radiation from scratch, assuming no previous background. In addition, we plan to review whichever topics seem to need reinforcement, so **please do not hesitate** to ask questions whenever necessary, either in class or in office hours.

*   First law of thermodynamics for closed and open systems. Also internal energy, enthalpy, and constant-pressure work.
*   Fourier's law. Thermal conductivity and its magnitude for various materials. Heat flux.
*   Modes of heat transfer. Conduction, convection, and thermal radiation.
*   Thermal resistance. The use of thermal resistance to analyze steady-state heat conduction.
*   Fins. Analysis of quasi-one-dimensional conduction in fins and application of results to various situations.
*   Boundary layers and internal flows. Awareness of these configurations, some knowledge of internal flow energy balances.
*   Convection correlations. Finding heat transfer coefficients from Reynolds numbers and Rayleigh numbers.
*   Heat Exchangers. Typical configurations and epsilon-NTU analysis.
*   Unsteady heat conduction. Lumped capacity model, awareness of one-dimensional unsteady results (charts; Biot and Fourier numbers)
*   Phase-change heat transfer. General awareness of processes of condensation and boiling in a pure substance, some use of correlations.
